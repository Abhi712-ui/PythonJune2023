# Variables

---

- `type(name)` -> gets the type of the variable -> `<class 'str'>`
- Naming convention for multi-word variable names is using an underscore between words.
- You can use either single or double quotes.
- You can't display a string literal and an integer variable together.
- To cast a different data type to a string, just use `str(other variable)`.
- `Float` = floating-point number (decimal).

# String methods

---

- `len()` -> returns the length.
- `name.find("a")` -> returns the first index where that character is found in the string.
- `name.capitalize()` -> capitalizes the first letter of the first word, but nothing else.
- `name.upper()` -> capitalizes the entire thing.
- `name.lower()` -> all lowercase.
- `name.isdigit()` -> Return True if the string is a digit string, False otherwise.
   A string is a digit string if all characters in the string are digits and there is at least one character in the string.
- `name.isalpha()` -> Return True if the string is an alphabetic string, False otherwise.
   A string is alphabetic if all characters in the string are alphabetic and there is at least one character in the string.
- `name.count("a")` -> returns the number of times this character occurs in the string.
- `name.replace("a", "b")` -> replaces all instances of the first character in the string with the second character.
- `print(name * 3)` -> displays the string name 3 times on the same line.
