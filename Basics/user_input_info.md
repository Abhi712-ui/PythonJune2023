# User Input

Certainly! Here's a basic rundown of user input in Python:

1. Prompting the User:
   - You can use the built-in `input()` function to display a prompt or message to the user, indicating what kind of input is expected. For example:

     ```python
     name = input("Enter your name: ")
     ```

2. Accepting User Input:
   - When the `input()` function is executed, the program will wait for the user to enter some input and press the "Enter" key.
   - The user's input is treated as a string and is returned by the `input()` function.
   - You can assign the user's input to a variable for further processing. For example, the user's name can be stored in the `name` variable as shown above.

3. Converting User Input:
   - By default, the `input()` function returns the user's input as a string.
   - If you need to convert the user's input to a specific data type, you can use typecasting. For example, to convert the user's input to an integer, you can use the `int()` function:

     ```python
     age = int(input("Enter your age: "))
     ```

4. Using User Input:
   - Once you have obtained the user's input and stored it in a variable, you can use it in your program as needed.
   - You can display the user's input, perform calculations, or use it in conditional statements, loops, or any other part of your program.

Here's a simple example that demonstrates the basic usage of user input in Python:

```python
name = input("Enter your name: ")
age = int(input("Enter your age: "))

print("Hello,", name)
print("You are", age, "years old.")
```

Certainly! Here's an explanation of each example in the Python user input demo:

1. Prompting the user for input:
   - The `input()` function is used to prompt the user to enter their name.
   - The entered value is stored in the `name` variable.
   - The program then prints a greeting message with the entered name.

2. Accepting integer input:
   - The `input()` function is used to prompt the user to enter their age.
   - The entered value is converted to an integer using the `int()` function and stored in the `age` variable.
   - The program then prints a message stating the user's age.

3. Accepting float input:
   - The `input()` function is used to prompt the user to enter their height in meters.
   - The entered value is converted to a float using the `float()` function and stored in the `height` variable.
   - The program then prints a message with the entered height.

4. Accepting multiple inputs:
   - The `input()` function is used to prompt the user to enter two numbers separated by a space.
   - The entered values are split using the `split()` function, which returns a list of substrings.
   - The values are then converted to integers and stored in the `num1` and `num2` variables.
   - The program calculates the sum of the two numbers and prints the result.

5. Accepting input with default value:
   - The `input()` function is used to prompt the user to enter their country.
   - The `or` operator is used to provide a default value of `'Unknown'` if the user does not enter anything.
   - The entered value or the default value is stored in the `country` variable.
   - The program then prints the entered country or the default value.

6. Accepting input without displaying a prompt:
   - The `input()` function is used without any argument, so it doesn't display a prompt.
   - The user can enter any value directly.
   - The entered value is stored in the `secret_code` variable.
   - The program then prints the secret code entered.

7. Using eval() to accept any valid Python expression:
   - The `input()` function is used to prompt the user to enter a Python expression.
   - The entered expression is evaluated using the `eval()` function, which interprets it as a valid Python expression.
   - The result of the expression is stored in the `result` variable.
   - The program then prints the result.

These examples demonstrate different scenarios of accepting user input, handling different data types, providing default values, and accepting various types of expressions.
