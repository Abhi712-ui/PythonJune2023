# Math Functions

Python provides a rich set of math functions in the built-in `math` module that allows you to perform various mathematical operations. Here's a detailed rundown of some of the commonly used math functions in Python:

1. **Absolute Value**: The `abs()` function returns the absolute value of a number.

2. **Exponentiation**: The `pow()` function raises a number to a specified power. The `**` operator can also be used for exponentiation.

3. **Square Root**: The `sqrt()` function returns the square root of a number.

4. **Trigonometric Functions**: Python provides several trigonometric functions such as `sin()`, `cos()`, `tan()`, `asin()`, `acos()`, `atan()`, etc. These functions operate on radians.

5. **Logarithmic Functions**: The `log()` function returns the natural logarithm of a number, and `log10()` returns the base-10 logarithm.

6. **Rounding Functions**: Python provides various rounding functions, including `round()`, `ceil()`, and `floor()`. `round()` rounds a number to the nearest integer, while `ceil()` and `floor()` round up and down to the nearest integer, respectively.

7. **Constants**: The `math` module also provides useful mathematical constants like `pi`, `e`, etc.

These are just a few examples of the math functions available in Python. The `math` module offers many more functions for advanced mathematical operations, such as logarithmic functions with custom bases, hyperbolic functions, and more. To use these functions, you need to import the `math` module at the beginning of your code using `import math`.

Apologies for the confusion. Here are some additional math functions available in the `math` module that were not covered earlier:

1. **Trigonometric Functions**:
   - `math.tan(x)`: Returns the tangent of `x` (in radians).
   - `math.atan(x)`: Returns the arctangent of `x` (in radians).
   - `math.atan2(y, x)`: Returns the arctangent of `y / x` (in radians), considering the signs of both arguments to determine the correct quadrant of the result.

2. **Hyperbolic Functions**:
   - `math.sinh(x)`: Returns the hyperbolic sine of `x`.
   - `math.cosh(x)`: Returns the hyperbolic cosine of `x`.
   - `math.tanh(x)`: Returns the hyperbolic tangent of `x`.
   - `math.asinh(x)`: Returns the inverse hyperbolic sine of `x`.
   - `math.acosh(x)`: Returns the inverse hyperbolic cosine of `x`.
   - `math.atanh(x)`: Returns the inverse hyperbolic tangent of `x`.

3. **Exponential and Logarithmic Functions**:
   - `math.exp(x)`: Returns *e* raised to the power of `x`.
   - `math.log1p(x)`: Returns the natural logarithm of `1 + x`.
   - `math.expm1(x)`: Returns *e* raised to the power of `x`, minus 1.
   - `math.log2(x)`: Returns the base-2 logarithm of `x`.
   - `math.log1p(x)`: Returns the natural logarithm of `1 + x`.
   - `math.log2(x)`: Returns the base-2 logarithm of `x`.
   - `math.log10(x)`: Returns the base-10 logarithm of `x`.

4. **Additional Constants**:
   - `math.inf`: Represents positive infinity.
   - `math.nan`: Represents a floating-point "not a number" (NaN).

These functions provide more advanced mathematical operations and calculations, such as trigonometric and hyperbolic functions, exponential and logarithmic functions, as well as additional constants for special values. You can use these functions by importing the `math` module and calling the respective function with the appropriate arguments.
