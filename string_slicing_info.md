# String Slicing

String slicing allows you to extract a portion of a string by specifying the start and end indices. The general syntax for string slicing is: `string[start:end:step]`.

- **Start Index**: The index where the slice starts (inclusive). If not provided, the slice starts from the beginning of the string (index 0).
- **End Index**: The index where the slice ends (exclusive). If not provided, the slice goes until the end of the string.
- **Step Size**: The number of indices to jump between characters in the slice. If not provided, the step size is 1.

Here are some key concepts related to string slicing:

- **Positive and Negative Indices**: In Python, you can access characters in a string using both positive and negative indices. Positive indices start from 0 and go up to `len(string) - 1`. Negative indices start from -1 and go down to `-len(string)`. Negative indices allow you to access characters from the end of the string.

String slicing is a powerful feature in Python that allows you to extract substrings from a larger string and manipulate them as needed. It provides flexibility and control for working with strings in various scenarios.
